Zio's Qwiic 16-ch PWM Servo Driver is a derivative of Adafruit's 16 Channel PWM Servo Driver.

The main difference is (you guessed it) the addition of two Qwiic connectors.

Adafruit's drivers are probably the best way of using it.

Note: As with all of the Version 1.0 Zio Qwiic boards, this board has been produced with the I2C pull-ups disconnected by default. If there's a significant length of wire between this board and your MCU, you'll need to solder closed the solder jumpers (labeled SDA, 3v3 and SCL) to connect the pull-up resistors to VCC.
